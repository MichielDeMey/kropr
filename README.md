Kropr - Client-side Image Cropper

An easy to drop in application for handling client side image cropping. Application is name spaced to ensure nothing conflicts with your code.
HTML element id's can be easily renamed in the settings so that this can work with your own conventions.

At the moment, this is purely a frontend application. Once you have cropped your image, right click and choose save. My next step is to build the server-side api component to make it easy to integrate with an upload script.

TO DO:

-proper error messaging

-choose image output type

-allow for scaling

-server side api

-customization to theming
